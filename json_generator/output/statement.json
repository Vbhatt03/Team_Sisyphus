Crime No.95/2024 I say that I know a boy by name Rajesh Sharma who was my tuition teacher when I used to attend coaching classes near Municipal Market, Margao. I say that I have one sister by name Sneha and Rajesh used to teach both of us Mathematics. After some time he started giving me special attention. We used to talk to each other, he used to ask me about my family and studies etc. I say that thereafter I became friendly with Rajesh. I say that two months back Rajesh started messaging me on WhatsApp. I say that Rajesh used to send me study materials through his phone and my mother saw some personal messages between Rajesh and me on the phone. Because of that my mother became suspicious and asked me to stay away from him. My mother informed me that Rajesh was older in age and a teacher and asked me to maintain proper boundaries. I say that I spoke to Rajesh from my own phone on several occasions. I say that Rajesh no longer teaches at the coaching center and he has moved to a different location.  I say that Rajesh informed me that he would help me with my studies on 10.10.2024. I say that Rajesh came near my house on the road on 10.10.2024 in the evening. I informed my family members that I was going to the library and I went with Rajesh. I say that from Margao we went to Panaji and he took me to a lodge near the bus stand. Crime No.95/2024 I say that at the lodge Rajesh told me that we would study there peacefully. I do not remember the exact time we reached the lodge. I say that at the lodge instead of studying, Rajesh behaved inappropriately with me. I say that we stayed at the lodge for approximately 3 hours. After that my parents called the police and they came to take me and brought me back home. I say that Rajesh touched me inappropriately at the lodge on that day. I say that I want to continue my studies and stay with my family."
